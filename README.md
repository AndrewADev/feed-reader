To run it, you must have both `npm` and Angular installed.

See here for installing npm: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

(Note that it can be useful to manage multiple node versions with the Node version manager: https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md )

See here for installing Angular: https://angular.io/guide/quickstart 

## Running

With dependencies installed, run the command `npm start`. This will fire up the app, and the backend server. It may take a couple seconds before both are running.
